# The rules

● The aim of the game is to successfully escape prison

● The player will begin in room 0, their “cell”, a description of the room is printed and 
they are prompted to move out of the cell

● The player can choose the direction they wish to move by entering “l” for left, “r” for
right, “f” for forward or “b” for back and can exit the game any time by entering “q”

● Depending on what direction they chose they will either find themselves in a new 
room with more options to progress or caught by a guard and “game over”

● If the direction they enter does not lead anywhere, or the player enters anything 
other than the listed options they will be asked to enter again

● There are 2 possible “rooms” to escape, 6 that lead to game over, 15 rooms in total
